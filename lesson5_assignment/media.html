                                 One of the most well-known cameras of all time, it was produced in Japan from 1976 to 1984 and was designed to be straightforward for beginners and hobbyists

                                 The Pentax is known for its durability, and was manufactured from 1976 to 1997, making it one of the longest produced 35mm SLR models of all time. It has sold over 3 million units, and is an entirely manual device.

                             <td>These cameras have been produced for a long time, making them and their parts very findable. They were made with a bunch of different models, from the original Nikon FM, Nikon FM2, Nikon FM2n, Nikon FM-10, Nikon FM3a and a few special variants (like the illusive Nikon FM2n Tropical Edition) </td>

The OM-1 even had a mirror-lock feature allowing for extended exposures, for night photography and astrophotography
